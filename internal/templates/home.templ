            <p class="text-base mt-6">My journey began in 2016 when I embarked 
            on building a website for my father’s business, finding the 
            complexities of backend and frontend development both challenging 
            and captivating. Shortly after, my eSports career took off, you can

            Over the years, I've developed software during my content creation 
            and gaming days, worked at a 
            <a class="text-secondary" href="https://signup.buildbox.com/">startup</a>, 
            and tackled ambitious projects at

            <p class="text-base mt-6">I'm focused on honing my engineering 
                skills by developing desktop and web applications that enhance 
                UX, including CLI tools, and Discord bots for D&D for friends. 
                I'm also exploring video game development. Each project refines 
                my skills and broadens my perspective. Learn more about my work

                find me outdoors hiking, capturing landscapes through 
                photography, staying active, or ticking off destinations from
