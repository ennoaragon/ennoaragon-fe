I quickly found  myself in over my head, grappling with server deployment and the  complexities of backend and frontend development. I found a  welcome distraction as my eSports career took off, which you  can read more about <a class=\"text-secondary\" href=\"/about\">here </a>.  It was fun but by 2019, I was ready to dive back into  programming. Since completing my undergraduate studies, I've  initiated numerous projects… though many have yet to see the  light of day. I've had the privilege to develop software  during my content creation and gaming days, working at a startup,  and  myself   <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://idropstudios.com\" class=\"text-secondary\">idropstudios</a>.</p><p class=\"text-base mt-6\">Today, my focus is on self-improvement  and honing my skills as an engineer. I've achieved this by  creating a diverse range of applications that deliver quick  responses and a seamless user experience (UX). My projects  include CLI tools, web apps for friends, and Discord  applications for my D&D campaigns. My most ambitious challenge  yet has been venturing into video game development. Each  project not only sharpens my technical skills but also broadens  my perspective as a developer.
